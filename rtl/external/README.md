This directory contains preprocessed Verilog sources for the P65C816
soft-core processor. This file is included for convenience
(regenerating requires [sv2v](https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v)).

This file can be regenerated from the
[nand2mario/snestang](https://github.com/nand2mario/snestang)
repository via the Makefile in the parent directory. Run
`make deep-clean` to remove, then re-running `make` should clone and
generate it.
